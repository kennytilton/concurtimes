# concurtimes

Prints out one or more text files in justified columns.

## Installation

There is a standalone executable in the bin directory.

## Usage
    $ cd /path/to/concurtimes
    $ bin/concurtimes --help

## Options
    $ bin/concurtimes --help
    
## Examples
To see 3 built-in test files printed in a "page" 80 characters
wide with 4 spaces padding between columns:

    $ bin/concurtimes -w80 -s4 -t3

To include arbitrary other files with one built-in:

    $ bin/concurtimes -w80 -s4 -t1 LICENSE src/concurtimes/core.clj
    
### Bugs
No known bugs, but I just thought of a limitation: you can add more built-ins to the resources directory
but there is an edit on the CLI args that prevents more than five from being shown.
