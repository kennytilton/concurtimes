The Cells Manifesto

by Kenneth Tilton, February 11, 2008

Cells is a mature, stable extension to CLOS allowing one to create classes whose instances can have slot values determined by instance-specific formulas. It is useful for any application involving an interesting amount of long-lived state and a stream of unpredictable inputs. Two examples are any GUI-based application and a RoboCup client (trying to simulate a soccer player given a stream of sensory data fed it by the game server).

Motivation
As a child I watched my father toil at home for hours over paper spreadsheets with pencil and slide rule. After he changed one value, he had to propagate that change to other cells by first remembering which other ones included the changed cell in their computation. Then he had to do the calculations for those, erase, enter...and then repeat that process to propagate those changes in a cascade across the paper.

VisiCalc let my father take the formula he had in mind and put it into (declare it to) the electronic spreadsheet. Then VisiCalc could do the tedious work: recalculating, knowing what to recalculate, and knowing in what order to recalculate.
