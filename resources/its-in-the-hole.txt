A Cinderella Story

by Bill Murray, July 25, 1980

What an incredible Cinderella story! This unknown comes out of nowhere to lead the pack.

He's on his final hole.

He's about 455 yards away. He's going to hit about a two iron, I think.

Oh, he got all of that.

The crowd is standing on its feet here at Augusta. The normally reserved Augusta crowd is going wild for this young Cinderella who has come out of nowhere...

He's got about 350 yards left. He's gonna hit about a five iron I'd expect. Don't you think?

He's got a beautiful back swing. That's...oh! He got all of that one!

He's got to be pleased with that.

The crowd is just on its feet here. He's a Cinderella boy. Tears in his eyes, I guess, as he lines up this last shot.

He's got about 195 yards left, and he's got... it looks like he's got about an eight iron.

This crowd has gone deadly silent. Cinderella story. Out of nowhere. A former greenskeeper now about to become the Master's champion.

It looks like a miraculous... it's in the hole! It's in the hole! He drops his club...
