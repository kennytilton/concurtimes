A Cinderella Story

by Bill Murray, July 25, 1980

What an incredible Cinderella story! This unknown comes out of nowhere to lead the pack.

He's on his final hole.

He's about 455 yards away. He's going to hit about a two iron, I think.

Well, he got all of that!

The crowd is standing on its feet. The normally reserved crowd is going wild for this young Cinderella who has come out of nowhere...

He's got about 350 yards left. He'll get a five iron I would expect. Don't you think?

He's got a beautiful back swing. That's...oh! He got all of that one!

He's got to be pleased with that.

The crowd is on its feet here. He's a Cinderella boy. Tears in his eyes, I guess, as he lines up this last shot.

He's got about 195 yards left, and looks like he's got an eight iron.

This crowd has gone deadly silent. Cinderella story. Out of nowhere. A former greenskeeper now about to become the Master's champion.

It's in the hole!
